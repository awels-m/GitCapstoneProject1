# GitCapstoneProject1
Here I will be submiting my Git capstone project 1 

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project aims at ensuring i gain mastery in git, from cloning of the git repository and working with different branches to staging, commiting, pushing changes, creating pull request and merging. 

# OBJECTIVES
this project aims at 
1. practicing of cloning a repository and working with branches in Git
2. gain experience in staging and commiting 
3. gain experience in pushing changes from different developers
4. create pull request and merge them after resolving any potential conflicts 

# PURPOSE

The purpose of the project is to help me gain mastery in the usage of git. through this project i was able to clone my repository and work on different branches. i was also able to gain experience in staging, commiting and gain experience in pushing changes from different developers. last but not the least, i was also able to create pull request and merge them after resolving any issue. 

# THE PRACTICAL
the first step is to create a repository and then clone the repository as well as enter into the repository on my terminal. the image below depicts this 
![1img](./1img.png)

i also initialized it with 'Readme'

the next thing to do is to create 4 different files and writte contents into it. the names of the files are:
1. home.html
2. aboutus.html
3. evens.html
4. contactus.html 

i am going to do this using 'vim'. the image below depicts thiss

![9img](./9img.png)
![10img](./10img.png)

the next thing to do is to stage, commit and push the changes into the main branch. the command used are
1. git add.
2. git commit-m
3. git push origin main'

# MORGANS WORK 
The first step is to create a new branch for morgan and then name the branch add-book-reviews as well add a new file named 'book_reviews.html and add a random text to it. 
these can be done using the following commands 
1. git checkout -b add-book-reviews
2. vim book_reviews.html
3. add a random text to it

the images below depicts this 
![12img](12img.png)
![13img](./13img.png)

the next thing to do is to stage, commit and push changes to github with a message "add book reviews section" and then push the branch 'add-book-reviews' to github. 
this is done by using the commands below
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "add book reviews section" 
3. git push origin add-book-reviews

the next thing to do is to request a pr for morgain and merge the changes with the main branch. this can be done on the github website. the image below depicts that

# JAMIES WORK

The first step is to create a new branch for morgan and then name the branch 'update-events' branch as well as add a new file and add a random text to it.
these can be done using the following commands
1. git checkout -b 'update-events'
2. vim "the file name"
3. add a random text
4. git add .
5. git commit -m 
6. git push origin 'update-events'

once the branch was made from the main branch all changes on the main branch would reflect on the new branch as long as nothing new was done on the main branch after the creation of the new branch. however, once the opposite is the case then the procedure to follow is 

1. git chechout main 
2. git pull origin main
3. git check out 'update-events'
4. git merge main


the next thing to do is to request a pr and merge changes with the main. the images below depicts this
